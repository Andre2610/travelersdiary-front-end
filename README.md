## **Introduction**

Hi, I am Andre, and this is my portfolio project, a web application App called Traveler's Diary. This is a MVP and not the final version. It is fully functional but missing some features that will be implemented in the future.

## **Traveler's Diary**

The idea behind this project is to give user's a platform to write their experiences while traveling by starting a trip and then make posts on that trip in a blog like style. Once the trip is over, the user can end the trip and all of the posts created during his/her trip will always remain grouped up. Once a user visits a trip, they will be able to read all the posts of that trip as well as check where the posts where made from, creating a sort of timeline of the trip.
